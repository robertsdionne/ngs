Wake up.

"Wake up," the Wake-on-LAN cron job notifies you. It's time to start your day.

Your cooling fans spin up as you open your eyes to see the blank interior planar surface of the door
to your housing unit. The housing chamber is only large enough for you to stand upright, but
luckily your mechanical muscles do not get tired.

Your tasks:

*if task_get_to_work_on_time
  ✓ Get to work on time.
*else
  ✗ Get to work on time.

Your desires:

*if desire_sleep_in
  ✓ Sleep in.
*else
  ✗ Sleep in.
