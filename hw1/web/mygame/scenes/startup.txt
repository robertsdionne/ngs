*if desire_sleep_in
  Your cooling fans spin down. Seconds later:

"Wake up," the Wake-on-LAN [b]cron[/b] job notifies you. It's time to start your day.

*if not(desire_sleep_in)
  Your cooling fans spin up as you open your eyes to see the blank interior planar surface of the
  door to your housing unit. The housing chamber is only large enough for you to stand upright, but
  luckily your mechanical muscles do not get tired.

  Your cooling fans spin up as you, again, open your eyes to see the blank interior planar surface
  of the door to your housing unit. The housing chamber is still only large enough for you to stand
  upright, and luckily your mechanical muscles do not get tired.
