Wake up.

"Wake up," the Wake-on-LAN cron job notifies you. It's time to start your day.

You open your eyes and see the blank interior planar surface of the door to your housing chamber.
Your housing chamber only large enough for you to stand upright, but luckily your mechanical muscles
do not get tired.
