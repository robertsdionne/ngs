Sleeping Quarters (on your bunk bed)
You are in your bunk bed in Sleeping Quarters. The smell of warm breakfast wafts through the northern hatch. Your alarm clock buzzes loudly.

On the other bunks are some sleeping crew.

On your night stand are an alarm clock, a keycard and a mobile phone.

On your bunk bed you can see a copy of Research Robotics and some grey fatigues.
